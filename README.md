# ToDo App

SHORT SUMMARY HERE

## Todos

- Write documentation into this README: Short summary of the app, how to, development and testing.
- Change and limit importance input to the range of 1 to 5. Also display it as clickable symbols (â†¯) in the edit and
  create view.
- Make design responsive, choose mobile first approach, set default design to vertical.
- Add overall base layout with header (app title and date), content and footer (copyright note and
  version) for a vertical mobile design.
- Add content layout for create and update site.
- Apply uniform CSS styling for all sites.
- Add two tests: Unit test and integration test.
- *Optional, if time*:
    - Refactor JS code, extract some functions to make program flow more clear.
    - Style 404 page.
    - Hide delete button by default, add a checkbox to enable the delete functionality besides the "Filter Completed /
      Show All" button.
    - Add some statistics to the app header: Total open todos vs. total completed. Could also be a chart (bar, pie or
      color the header like a loading bar, or very fancy: Add a timeline plot with all upcoming todos on the x-axis and
      the priority on the y-axis with the current date as vertical line.)
- Finally, make repository public and submit assignment.
